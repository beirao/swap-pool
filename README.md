## Prerequisites üîß

To compile and test the contracts, we utilize [foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry). Make sure to familiarize yourself with its environment and setup.

## How It Works üß†

### Internal Flash Accounting üí°

- The pool uses an "in-memory" method to keep track of all operations, whether they are for providing liquidity or executing multi-hop swaps.
- Instead of making changes immediately, all balance updates are first recorded internally. This helps in only settling the net changes at the end of an operation block.
- To track these changes, a hash-map is utilized, residing solely in memory. The caller specifies its size when beginning a batch of operations:
  - A smaller hash-map is more gas-efficient due to lesser upfront memory allocation. However, it has a higher risk of key collisions, which can make some operations more costly. 
  - The optimal hash-map size can be determined through off-chain transaction simulations.

### Program üìú

- Interactions with the pools are facilitated via the `execute(bytes program)` function.
- The "program" is essentially a serialized set of operations and follows a specific structure:
  - The first 2 bytes denote the accounting hash map size in terms of tokens. For instance, `0x0040` stands for a map that accommodates up to 64 key-value pairs.
  - Every subsequent operation within this program comprises:
    - An 8-bit operation, spanning 1 byte.
    - Data pertaining to the opcode, spanning 'n' bytes.
- This encoding method ensures minimal calldata size, given that each operation might need different data amounts.

### Operations üîß

- An 8-bit operation specifier contains two parts:
  - The first 4 bits (half) represent the operation ID.
  - The latter 4 bits represent flags.
- Thus, there's the potential for up to 16 primary operations. Each can interpret 4 additional flags.
- Parameters are always packed tightly.
- Encoding of individual operations can be found in the `EncoderLib`.
- **Note**: Operation names are from the pool's viewpoint. For example, "send" means the pool is transferring assets to an external party.

### Supported Operations (Ops) üõ†Ô∏è

The system has a set of predefined operations that can be executed within the pool. These operations are represented as constants in the `Ops` library.

- **SWAP Operation**: Used for swap transactions.
  - **Operation Type**: `SWAP = 0x00`
  - **Direction Flag**: 
    - Used to extract the operation's direction.
    - `SWAP_DIR = 0x01`

- **SEND_ALL Operation**: Enables the pool to send all tokens to a user.
  - **Operation Type**: `SEND_ALL = 0x10`
  - **Bounds**:
    - Minimum: `ALL_MIN_BOUND = 0x01`
    - Maximum: `ALL_MAX_BOUND = 0x02`

- **RECEIVE_ALL Operation**: Allows a user to send all their tokens to the pool.
  - **Operation Type**: `RECEIVE_ALL = 0x20`
  - **Bounds**:
    - Minimum: `ALL_MIN_BOUND = 0x01`
    - Maximum: `ALL_MAX_BOUND = 0x02`

- **SEND Operation**: Enables the pool to send tokens to a user.
  - **Operation Type**: `SEND = 0x30`

- **RECEIVE Operation**: Allows a user to send tokens to the pool.
  - **Operation Type**: `RECEIVE = 0x40`

- **PERMIT_WITHDRAW_VIA_SIG Operation**: Enables operations using EIP-2612's permit functionality.
  - **Operation Type**: `PERMIT_WITHDRAW_VIA_SIG = 0x50`

- **ADD_LIQ Operation**: Used to add liquidity to the pool.
  - **Operation Type**: `ADD_LIQ = 0x60`

- **RM_LIQ Operation**: Used to remove liquidity from the pool.
  - **Operation Type**: `RM_LIQ = 0x70`

- **CLAIM_ALL_FEES Operation**: Allows the operator to claim fees.
  - **Operation Type**: `CLAIM_ALL_FEES = 0x80`

Each operation is uniquely identified by a combination of its type and possible flags. The `MASK_OP` is used to extract the type of operation, with its value being `MASK_OP = 0xf0`.

## Contract Structure üìú

```ml
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Ops.sol               - Contains the list of all available operations (Ops).
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ encoder
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DecoderLib.sol    - Helps decode data for each operation.
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ EncoderLib.sol    - Assists off-chain users. Not for on-chain use.
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ lib
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AccounterLib.sol  - Library with in-memory accounting logic.
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MemMappingLib.sol - Logic to build in-memory key-value mappings.
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SwapLib.sol       - Contains computations related to swap operations.

```

Always remember: Use `EncoderLib` exclusively in off-chain scenarios for optimal gas efficiency.
