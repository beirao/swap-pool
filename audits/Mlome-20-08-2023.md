# Audit Result

## [High Severity] User can steal ETH deposited into the pool
### Summary
The ETH deposited in the contract can be collected by any user in the `_receive()` function then withdrawn at anytime.

### Vulnerability Details
The `MonoPool.sol` contract allows ETH to be depostited via `receive() external payable {}` 
(Link to code)[https://github.com/frak-id/swap-pool/blob/7eb742e9f6612e4e1f64dbe0cae5f5b0f1d2f03e/src/MonoPool.sol#L124]
An attacker can then `execute` a call to `_receive` with the `amount` equal to the amount of ETH deposited. At this point the `_receive()` function will credit the user of `WrappedNativeToken` which can then be immediately unwrapped and withdrawn from the pool.

```solidity
File: MonoPool.sol

L275:	function _receive(Accounter memory accounter, uint256 ptr, uint256 op) internal returns (uint256) {
        // Get the right token depending on the input
        address token;
        TokenState storage tokenState;
        (ptr, token, tokenState,) = _getTokenFromBoolInPtr(ptr);

        // Get the amount
        uint256 amount;
        (ptr, amount) = ptr.readUint(16);

        // Check if that's a native op or not
        if (op & Ops.NATIVE_TOKEN == 0) {
            // Perform the transfer
            token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        } else {
            // Otherwise, in case of a native token, perform the deposit
            IWrappedNativeToken(token).deposit{ value: amount }(); // @audit should check that the amount comes from msg.sender
        }

        // Mark the reception state
        _accountReceived(accounter, tokenState, token);

        return ptr;
    }
```
### Impact
All Native Tokens sent to the pool can be stolen by the user.

### Recommendations
One possible fix could be to keep track of user's Native Token (ETH) balance in the `accounter` in the same way as `token0` and `token1`.


## Gas Optimizations
| |Issue|Instances|
|-|:-|:-:|
| [GAS-01] | Don't Initialize Variables with Default Value | 2 | 
| [GAS-02] | Splitting `require()` statements that use `&&` saves gas | 2 | 
| [GAS-03] | Setting the `constructor` to `payable` | 1 | 
| [GAS-04] | Usage of uint/int smaller than 32 bytes | 2 | 
| [GAS-05] | Use `<`/`>` instead of `>=`/`>=` | 5 | 
| [GAS-06] | `<x> += <y>` Costs More Gas Than `<x> = <x> + <y>` For State Variables | 4 | 

### [GAS-01] Don't Initialize Variables with Default Value
Uninitialized variables are assigned with the types default value.<br>Explicitly initializing a variable with it's default value costs unnecessary gas.

*Instances (2)*:
```solidity
File: MonoPool.sol
353:        uint256 minSend = 0;

395:        uint256 minReceive = 0;

```

### [GAS-02] Splitting `require()` statements that use `&&` saves gas
Instead of using operator `&&` on a single `require`. Using a two `require` can save more gas.
i.e. for `require(size >= 1 && size <= 32);` use:
```solidity
require(size >= 1);
require(size <= 32);
```

*Instances (2)*:
```solidity
File: encoder/DecoderLib.sol
25:        require(size >= 1 && size <= 32);

42:        require(size >= 1 && size <= 32);

```

### [GAS-03] Setting the `constructor` to `payable`
Saves ~13 gas per instance

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: MonoPool.sol
91:    constructor(address token0, address token1, uint256 feeBps, address _feeReceiver, uint16 _protocolFee) {

```

### [GAS-04] Usage of uint/int smaller than 32 bytes
When using elements that are smaller than 32 bytes, your contract's gas usage may be higher. This is because the EVM operates on 32 bytes at a time. Therefore, if the element is smaller than that, the EVM must use more operations in order to reduce the size of the element from 32 bytes to the desired size. Each operation involving a uint8 costs an extra 22-28 gas (depending on whether the other operand is also a variable of type uint8) as compared to ones involving uint256, due to the compiler having to clear the higher bits of the memory word before operating on the uint8, as well as the associated stack operations of doing so. https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.11/internals/layout_in_storage.html<br>Use a larger size then downcast where needed.

*Instances (2)*:
```solidity
File: MonoPool.sol
91:    constructor(address token0, address token1, uint256 feeBps, address _feeReceiver, uint16 _protocolFee) {

127:    function updateFeeReceiver(address _feeReceiver, uint16 _protocolFee) external {

```

### [GAS-05] Use `<`/`>` instead of `>=`/`>=`
In Solidity, there is no single op-code for <= or >= expressions. What happens under the hood is that the Solidity compiler executes the LT/GT (less than/greater than) op-code and afterwards it executes an ISZERO op-code to check if the result of the previous comparison (LT/ GT) is zero and validate it or not. Example:
```solidity
// Gas cost: 21394
function check() exernal pure returns (bool) {
		return 3 >= 3;
}
```
```solidity
// Gas cost: 21391
function check() exernal pure returns (bool) {
		return 3 > 2;
}
```
The gas cost between these contract differs by 3 which is the cost executing the ISZERO op-code,**making the use of < and > cheaper than <= and >=.**

*Instances (5)*:
```solidity
File: encoder/DecoderLib.sol
25:        require(size >= 1 && size <= 32);

25:        require(size >= 1 && size <= 32);

42:        require(size >= 1 && size <= 32);

42:        require(size >= 1 && size <= 32);

```

```solidity
File: utils/ReentrancyGuard.sol
2:pragma solidity >=0.8.0;

```

### [GAS-06] `<x> += <y>` Costs More Gas Than `<x> = <x> + <y>` For State Variables
Using the addition operator instead of plus-equals saves **[113 gas](https://gist.github.com/MiniGlome/f462d69a30f68c89175b0ce24ce37cae)**
Same for `-=`, `*=` and `/=`.

*Instances (4)*:
```solidity
File: MonoPool.sol
257:                token0State.protocolFees += swapFee;

261:                token1State.protocolFees += swapFee;

319:            tokenState.totalReserves -= amount;

369:            tokenState.totalReserves -= amount;

```
