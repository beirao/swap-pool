## Auditor

## Date

## Context
The audit was generously offered for free by Nisedo. It serves as a global overview of the project, with a primary focus on the MonoPool.sol contract. The intention was to understand the contract's general functionality and to evaluate any evident vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.

## Scope
Files included in the audit:
- MonoPool.sol

## Audit Result
Of course, let's format the findings to make them more readable:

### General Issues:

- The contracts do not emit any events, making on-chain activity tracking more challenging.
- Avoid using floating pragmas in all contracts.

### Findings in `MonoPool.sol`:

1. **Data Input Validation**: 
    - The contract lacks data input validation which might lead to unforeseen behaviors.
  
2. **Misleading Comment**: 
    - The comment for `Pool private pool;` suggests it's a mapping, whereas it's a struct.
  
3. **Incorrect Function Calls**: 
    - All `pool.functions()` of this contract seem to be calling on a struct, not an address in a mapping.
  
4. **Protocol Fee Initialization**: 
    - In the constructor, `protocolFee = _protocolFee;` can be set to values greater than `MAX_PROTOCOL_FEE`.
  
5. **Typo in Comment**: 
    - `/// @dev Just tell use that this smart contract can receive native tokens` has a typo: "use" should be "us".
  
6. **Fee Receiver Initialization**: 
    - If `feeReceiver` is set to the `0` address either in the constructor or via `updateFeeReceiver()`, it would be impossible to update again due to the condition `if (feeReceiver != msg.sender) revert NotFeeReceiver();`.
  
7. **Typo in Comment**: 
    - `// Ensure the sender of the message of the fee receiver` has a typo: "of the fee receiver" should be "is the fee".

### Findings in `PoolLib.sol`:

1. **Input Validation**: 
    - In `addLiquidity()` (and in `execute()`) there's no input validation for the `to` address against the zero address. Tokens could be burned if a zero address is passed.
  
2. **Swap Amount Check**: 
    - In `swap()`, there's no check for `amount > reserves`.
  
3. **Potential Division by Zero**: 
    - What happens if `total liquidity == 0` after a user calls `removeLiquidity()`? This could potentially lead to a division by zero in future operations, like in `estimateSwap()`.

### Findings in `MonoPoolSwap.t.sol`:

1. **Swap Amount Testing**: 
    - For the declaration `uint256 constant swapAmount = 1.8 ether;` why do tests pass with any value (e.g., `6` or `10`) instead of an ether value?

### Findings in `BaseMonoPoolTest.sol`:

1. **Typo in Comment**: 
    - `/// @dev Generic contract to test ono pool, providing some helpers` has a typo: "ono" should be "Mono".
